### Hi there 👋

Before: I'm really sorry for my bad english.

My name is Denis and I am a backend developer in web. My primary programming language is `php`. But I'm also interested in `golang` and `c#`. Also somehow know a litte about fronend thigs: `react`, `redux`, `vuejs`. I like, when all around me is dokerized, that's why I do a lot things with docker (but mostly of this are kind a stupid things).

Once a year I write something not useful in [my blog](https://dannecron.github.io).

Fun ~~no~~ facts:
- 🎮 I am a gamer playing on [pc](https://steamcommunity.com/id/dannc) and [ps](https://my.playstation.com/profile/DanNecron).
- 🍥 I am an [anime fan](https://myanimelist.net/profile/DanNC).
- 🎧 I am listeninig [a lot of music](https://www.last.fm/ru/user/DanNecron).
